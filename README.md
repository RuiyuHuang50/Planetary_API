# RESTful API with Python and Flask

## Project Overview

This project aims to provide fundamental knowledge for developing RESTful APIs using Python and Flask for enabling data exchange between various client applications and endpoints, With a focus on a mobile-first approach, to create, secure, and test effective APIs for web and mobile projects.

## Learning Objectives

- Create a new Flask project
- Test APIs using Postman
- Return JSON responses instead of plain text
- Interact with databases
- Implement user authentication
- Secure APIs against unauthorized access

## Skills Covered

- REST APIs
- Flask framework
- Database access and management
- API security and user authentication

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- Postman (for testing the APIs)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Application

1. **Set environment variables:**

   You may need to set the `FLASK_APP` environment variable:

   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app.py  # On Windows use `set FLASK_APP=app.py`
   ```

2. **Run the application:**

   ```bash
   flask run
   ```

   The application should now be running at `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

### Testing the API

You can test the API endpoints using Postman. Make sure to use the appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) as defined in your API.

### Usage Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to test the API endpoint:

1. Open Postman.
2. Select the HTTP method (GET, POST, etc.).
3. Enter the URL (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/resource`).
4. Add any required headers (like `Content-Type: application/json`).
5. Send the request and observe the response.
